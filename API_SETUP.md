# Google Play Scraper Integration Setup

## Overview
This app store now has a **built-in Google Play scraper** that directly fetches real app data from Google Play Store without requiring external API services.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
**No external API configuration needed!** The scraper is now built into the app.

The app no longer requires:
- External Google Play API server
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLAY_API_URL` environment variable
- Separate hosting of API services

### 2. Built-in Scraper
The app now includes:
1. **Integrated Google Play scraper**: Uses `google-play-scraper` library
2. **Direct API routes**: All endpoints are now internal Next.js API routes
3. **No external dependencies**: Everything runs within your Next.js app

### 3. Built-in API Endpoints
- `/api/apps?category=APPLICATION&collection=TOP_FREE` - Get top free apps by category
- `/api/apps/[id]` - Get app details by ID
- `/api/search?term=search_term` - Search for apps
- `/api/categories` - Get all available categories
- `/api/developers/[devId]` - Get apps by developer

## Current Implementation

### Features
- ✅ **Real-time app data** from Google Play Store (built-in scraper)
- ✅ **Loading states** with skeleton components
- ✅ **Error handling** with fallback to mock data
- ✅ **Responsive grid layouts** for different screen sizes
- ✅ **App cards** with real app information (icons, ratings, prices)
- ✅ **No external API dependencies** - everything runs internally

### App Sections
1. **Recommended for you** - Productivity apps (8 apps in compact grid)
2. **Tools & utilities** - Tools category apps (8 apps in compact grid)
3. **Trending Apps** - Top free apps (6 apps in detailed grid)
4. **Browse by Category** - Category navigation (unchanged)

### Data Structure
Apps now include:
- Real app icons from Google Play Store
- Actual ratings and review counts (score and scoreText)
- Real developer information (devId and developer URL)
- Price information (price in USD, free boolean)
- Direct links to app details, permissions, reviews, and similar apps

## Development Notes

### Scraper Integration Status
✅ **Now using built-in Google Play scraper**
- Real-time app data from Google Play Store
- Live search results and category listings
- Actual app ratings, downloads, and information
- No external API server required - everything runs internally

### Scraper Integration Points
- `src/app/lib/googlePlayScraper.ts` - Built-in Google Play scraper service
- `src/app/api/apps/route.ts` - Apps API endpoint using scraper
- `src/app/api/apps/[id]/route.ts` - App details API endpoint
- `src/app/api/search/route.ts` - Search API endpoint
- `src/app/api/categories/route.ts` - Categories API endpoint
- `src/app/hooks/useGooglePlayApps.ts` - React hooks with internal API calls
- `src/app/components/AppCard.tsx` - App display component
- `src/app/components/AppCardSkeleton.tsx` - Loading states

### Next Steps
1. ✅ **Built-in Google Play scraper** integrated
2. ✅ **Internal API routes** implemented
3. ✅ **Live app data** displaying from Google Play Store
4. ✅ **Search functionality** - Available via `/api/search`
5. ✅ **App detail pages** - Available via `/api/apps/[id]`
6. ✅ **Categories** - Available via `/api/categories`
7. **Implement pagination** - Handle large result sets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Scraper errors**: Check console for Google Play scraper errors
- **Rate limiting**: Google Play has strict rate limits; the scraper handles this automatically
- **Image loading**: App icons may fail to load; fallback to colored initials
- **Network issues**: Ensure your server has internet access to Google Play Store

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging by checking the browser console for:
- Scraper request logs
- Response data
- Error messages
- Fallback behavior
